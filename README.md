Link Sharing App Roadmap3


This project involves both frontend and backend development, user interface design, and potentially user authentication. Here's an outline of how you could approach building such a project using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.


**Frontend (React):**

1. **Create a New Project:** Set up your React project using Create React App or a similar tool.

2. **Design Mockup:** Design the mobile mockup using a design tool or a UI library. You can use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch for this purpose.

3. **Link Management:**

   - Create a component for managing links.
   - Implement functionality to add, read, update, and delete links.
   - Validate URL patterns using regular expressions or a validation library.
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering links.

4. **Profile Details:**

   - Create a component for managing profile details.
   - Implement input fields for profile picture, first name, last name, and email.
   - Implement validation for required fields (first name, last name).
   - Implement image upload functionality for the profile picture.

5. **Preview and Copy:**

   - Create a preview component for the devlinks profile.
   - Implement a button to copy the profile link to the clipboard.

6. **Responsive Design:**

   - Use CSS media queries to adapt the layout based on the device's screen size.
   - Ensure the interface is optimized for various screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).

7. **Interactive Elements:**

   - Apply CSS styles to demonstrate hover and focus states for interactive elements.

8. **User Authentication **

   - Implement user registration and login functionality using a library like Firebase Authentication.
   - Secure routes and components that require authentication.

**Backend (Node.js with Express):**

1. **Create a New Project:** Set up your Node.js project with Express using npm or yarn.

2. **Database Setup:**

   - Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store link and profile details.
   - Use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like Mongoose.

3. **API Endpoints:**

   - Create API endpoints for link CRUD operations and profile details.
   - Implement validation and error handling for incoming data.

4. **User Authentication (Bonus):**

   - Implement user registration and login endpoints.
   - Use a library like Passport.js for authentication.

5. **API Testing:** Test your API endpoints using tools like Postman or Insomnia.

**Full-Stack Deployment:**

1. **Frontend Deployment:** Deploy the React frontend using platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

2. **Backend Deployment:** Deploy the Node.js backend to a hosting service like Heroku or AWS.
